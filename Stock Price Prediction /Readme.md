### Task 2:📈 Netflix Stock Price Prediction
Build a model to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data, including
features like opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. Your task is
to preprocess the data, choose a suitable model (e.g., linear regression or LSTM),
train it, and evaluate its prediction accuracy


### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical stock market data.
The dataset used in this project is Netflix (NFLX) historical stock data containing 1009 records with features such as:
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adjusted Close
- Volume
- Date

### 🎯 Objectives

- Understand historical stock data behavior
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Prepare data for machine learning
- Train regression models for price prediction
- Evaluate model performance
- Compare model accuracy

The goal of this project is to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build machine learning models, and evaluate prediction accuracy
