### Task 2:📈 Netflix Stock Price Prediction
Build a model to predict future stock prices based on historical stock data, including
features like opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. Your task is
to preprocess the data, choose a suitable model (e.g., linear regression or LSTM),
train it, and evaluate its prediction accuracy


### 📌 Overview
This project is part of my Data Scientist Internship tasks. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices based on historical data. The dataset includes features such as:

- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adjusted Close
- Volume
- Date

### WorkFlow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Modeling (Linear regression)
5. Evaluation (r2 score,MSE)

### 📊 Results
- Achieved R² ≈ 0.99 on test data.
- Mean Squared Error ≈ 16 (indicating average squared deviation from actual prices).
